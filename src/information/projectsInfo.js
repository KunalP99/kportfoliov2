    learned: 'This is my first independent full-stack project so it taught me a lot about the backend and databases. I learnt how the backend is hosted and how the frontend accesses data from a database. I have gained a much better understanding for HTTP methods and how they interact with the backend and frontend. I really enjoyed the process of creating both the backend and frontend and want to create bigger and better projects like this in the future.'
