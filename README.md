# kportvoliov2
I decided to create another portfolio to better showcase my skills so far. From the design to the code, I pushed myself to create something better than what I had before. 

Before this portfolio, I didn't have a true understanding of `position: absolute` so I went with a design that would implement this and produced it. I also wanted to improve my commits on GitHub. To do this, I followed [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) specification on how to commit and found myself constructing more informative and precise commits.
