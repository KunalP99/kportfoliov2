I decided to create another portfolio to better showcase my skills so far. From the design to the code, I pushed myself to create something better than what I had before.

Before this portfolio, I didn't have a true understanding of `position: absolute` so I went with a design that would implement this and produced it. Additionally, I sought to enhance my commit quality on GitHub. I adhered to the guidelines outlined in the Conventional Commits specification, resulting in more informative and precise commits.

## New features
- Stylised hero page
- Animated cards for each project
- Modals for each project describing the project and its features
- Videos for all projects embedded in the modals 
- An auto scrolling carousel of images
- Dark and light theme 
- An interest section with images showing at intervals

## API
[Swiper.js](https://swiperjs.com/)
